It's tough being a clumsy pirate. You trip and fall all the time, your parrot flies into things, and occasionally (well, more than just occasionally) you even lose your treasure. Because of all of this, we have to be super careful so Blackbeard doesn't get even more mad at us. We were just sent on a mission to pick up some treasure found on the shore of a deserted island. Let's make sure we get all the gems in our treasure chest!


## Let's Get Started

### Step 1:

Click `Open in Nitrous` at the top of this page to bring this lesson down so you can edit files in Nitrous.

### Step 2:

Open `index.html` in the browser by running in terminal `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`. 

Once you have the server running, select `preview` and then `port 3000`.

You're going to code your solution in `css/gems.css`. Go ahead and open that file in the Nitrous text editor, as well as `index.html`. Please don't make any changes to `css/style.css` or to `index.html`.

### Move the Ruby

Obviously we want to go for the biggest gem first. As a pirate, there is always the risk of attack by enemy ships. Time is always of the essence, and the ruby is the biggest stone. 

Once you fill in the selector in `css/gems.css` Save the changes to `css/gems.css` and refresh in the browser. You should have put the ruby in the chest. &#10003;

### Move the Emerald

Emeralds are pretty expensive so we should probably collect that gem next.

In `css/gems.css`, you'll want to replace the text `/*selector for emerald goes here */` with the CSS selector.

Save the changes to `css/gems.css` and refresh in the browser. Emerald done. &#10003;

### Move The Yellow Diamond

Everyone loves a good yellow diamond, so let's make sure we get that gem into our treasure chest. Again, you'll want to look for any classes or ID's defined on the yellow diamond image in `index.html`.

Save your changes and refresh in the browser. Yellow diamond complete. &#10003;

### Move the Diamond

<img src="images/diamond-gem.png" align="right" width="100px" hspace="10">

Take a look at `index.html` for any classes or ID's defined on the diamond image. Use that as your CSS selector in `css/gems.css`.

Diamond done.  &#10003; 


### Move The Sapphire

<img src="images/sapphire-gem.png" align="right" width="100px" hspace="10">

We saved the hardest for last, this way if we get attacked now, we can run away with four gems instead of just one. The sapphire is going to be pretty tricky to move. There aren't any IDs or classes defined on the `img` tag. But, if you look carefully, you'll notice the `img` tag linking the sapphire is nested inside of a `div` with the id `sand`. This `img` tag is known as a child element of the parent, which is the `div`. 

```html
    <div id="sand">
      <img src="images/sapphire-gem.png" alt="Sapphire">
    </div>

```

In order to select the sapphire image in our CSS, we can use what's called a descendant selector. In `css/gems.css` you'll want to replace the text `/*selector for sapphire goes here */ ` with `#sand img`. 

`#sand img` is our CSS selector. This selector will first look for an HTML tag with the ID `sand`, and from there, look for the `img` child HTML element, and apply that styling to the `img`.

Sapphire.  &#10003;
